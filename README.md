# Project 1: [Recipe Data Analysis from Allrecipes](https://github.com/ryanjcarroll/Recipes-Data-Analysis)
* Web scraped ~4,000 recipes from Allrecipes.com using Python's BeautifulSoup and JSON libraries.
* Using Pandas, cleaned the data. This included extracting ingredient names, converting various cook time formats to consistent numerical values, and locating HTML elements across multiple webpage layouts.
* Generated charts of the most common ingredients, title keywords, and instructions using Matplotlib.
* Analyzed distribution of recommended serving sizes and cook times, and generated visualizations using Matplotlib.
